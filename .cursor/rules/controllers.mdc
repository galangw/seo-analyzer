- [ProfileController.php](mdc:seo-analyzer/app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php) - Handles user profile management
- [HomeController.php](mdc:seo-analyzer/app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php) - Controls the landing page and home views

## API Controllers

- [ApiController.php](mdc:seo-analyzer/app/Http/Controllers/ApiController.php) - Base controller for API endpoints
- API endpoints in [app/Http/Controllers/Api](mdc:seo-analyzer/app/Http/Controllers/Api) directory

## Authentication Controllers

Authentication controllers are in the [app/Http/Controllers/Auth](mdc:seo-analyzer/app/Http/Controllers/Auth) directory, handling login, registration, password resets, etc.
