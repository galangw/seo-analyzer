# SEO Score System

The application uses a color-coded scoring system for SEO analysis:

- **Success (Green)**: Score ≥ 80% - Excellent SEO optimization
- **Warning (Yellow/Orange)**: Score ≥ 50% and < 80% - Fair SEO optimization, needs improvement
- **Danger (Red)**: Score < 50% - Poor SEO optimization, requires significant improvement

This scoring logic is applied to overall scores and individual component scores (title, meta description, content).

```javascript
const scoreClass = score >= 80 ? 'success' : (score >= 50 ? 'warning' : 'danger');
```

The UI displays these scores with gradient-colored progress bars and text formatting that corresponds to the score level.
