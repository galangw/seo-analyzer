# Analysis Workflow

The SEO analyzer application follows these workflows:

## Content Editing
1. The user edits content using the Quill rich text editor
2. Character counters track title and meta description lengths
3. Content validation occurs before any analysis

## Analysis Methods
1. **Preview Analysis**: Temporary analysis without saving (uses `api.analyze-content`)
   - Form validation
   - AJAX request to analysis endpoint
   - Results displayed in the UI without saving

2. **Update & Reanalyze**: Saves content and performs analysis
   - Form validation
   - Content saved via PUT request
   - Redirects to results page after successful update

## AI Assistance
1. **AI Title Suggestion**: Generates title based on content and target keyword
   - Requires content and target keyword
   - Makes request to `api.suggest-title` endpoint

2. **AI Meta Description Suggestion**: Generates meta description
   - Requires content and target keyword
   - Makes request to `api.suggest-meta-description` endpoint
